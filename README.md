# Amazing Custom Stuff

ACS is a WP plugin that will allow you to add boxes with editable fields into almost any area of your backend.

# License (GPL v2 or later)

This is a derivative work of the "GPL v2 or later" plugin ACF PRO 5.9.5 that was developed by a great developer called Elliot Condon.

# Differences between ACF and ACS

First of all, ACS is not ACF. There are many similarities between both plugins because ACS is a fork of ACF.

In ACS, the code related to WordPress Gutenberg Blocks was removed, since it's directed towards [WP-CMS](https://github.com/wp-cms/), the "Gutenfree" version of WordPress.

# Ethics

This plugin depends on many things, to make sense. It depends on the people who created PHP, the scientists who made digital screens possible, the people who worked on making WordPress, those who made jQuery... It probably depends on the work of more than a thousand brains that aren't even alive anymore.

Yes, I believe it's unethical to copy and re-release a work done by a developer who struggles to make a living out of the product. I don't intend to do any harm to the big company that bought the original product. I just want to make this available for free to the developers who don't like the fact that WordPress became "blocky", so I am making sure that this fork does not include "blocky" related code and stays focused towards [WP-CMS](https://github.com/wp-cms/).
